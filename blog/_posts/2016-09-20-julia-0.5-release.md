title:  Julia 0.5 ("Functopia")
author: Stefan Karpinski

The 0.5 release of Julia is much more than we hoped for, but it's quite different than we anticipated. Rather than *the arrays release* (aka "Arraymageddon"), it ended up being above all *the functional programming release*. Of course,

Julia has always been a functional language in the technical sense – functions are values that can pass to and from other functions (i.e. [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function)) and there is full support for [lambdas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function). Before Julia 0.5, however, anonymous and higher-order functions came with a significant performance cost. In a language that targets very high-performance technical computing, that's a problem. So the Julia standard library and ecosystem have been rife with work-arounds to get the expressiveness of functional programming without the performance problems. But the right solution, of course, is to just make functional programming fast – ideally just as fast as the optimal hand-written version of your code would be. In Julia 0.5, it is. And that changes everything.

That's not the only change in Julia 0.5, of course.
